In today’s digital era, the massive volume of documents produced daily is increasingly prone to tampering and misuse, raising serious concerns about authenticity and trust. Traditional verification methods are slow, error-prone, and heavily dependent on physical checks.
 To address this, we propose a framework combining blockchain and NFTs to give each document a unique, tamper-proof identity. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows secure validation directly on encrypted data, while Threshold Cryptography distributes trust by requiring multiple parties for decryption. An AI-based verification layer further strengthens the system by automatically detecting anomalies and reducing human error.
 Together, these technologies create a secure, efficient and scalable ecosystem where documents are immutable, private, and verifiable shifting from fragile digital files to trusted digital assets, enhancing both security and trust in document management.
