In today’s digital era, the massive volume of documents produced daily is increasingly prone
to tampering and misuse, raising serious concerns about authenticity and trust. Traditional verification
methods are slow, error-prone, and heavily dependent on manual checks. To address this, we propose a
comprehensive framework that combines the immutability of blockchain with the programmable ownership
of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to give each document a unique, tamper-proof digital identity. Fully
Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows secure, blind validation and computation directly on encrypted
data, enabling an AI-based verification layer to automatically detect anomalies and fraud without
compromising document privacy. Furthermore, Threshold Cryptography distributes access control by
requiring a quorum of authorized parties for document decryption, preventing unilateral access or alteration.
Together, these technologies create a secure, efficient, and scalable ecosystem where digital documents
transition from fragile files to trusted, programmable assets, enhancing both security and compliance in
document management.
